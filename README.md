## *Shopping Cart*

 Add products to cart via product page. Easy to maintain, simply add product/s to the database and the code does the rest using a for loop to output the data to the page. no messing about in the code.

## *TO DO*
 
 Fix the shopping cart, code is there but it throws a funny error. Had it working but then I broke it somehow. Shouldn't be much of a problem.
